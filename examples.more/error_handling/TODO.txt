1. Add a demo about how to catch this exception from regular C code using signal and
	sigaction and show what can be done about it (c level).
3. Example of how to raise exceptions on all system calls.
	C++ wrapper for all system calls.
4. Examples of debugging malloc stuff:
	showing statistics of malloc,
	hooking into the malloc free hooks
	replacing the malloc library.
5. Expand the example BreakOut.cc to show that you can break out of other system calls too (for example shmget).
