Dynamic proxy exercise:

part A
======
Write a method like Collections.synchronize. The method accepts an object
of an unknown type and returns a proxy to that object. The input object is
assumed to be non synchronized and the output object is a proxy which *is*
synchronized using a single lock on all the methods.

part B
======
Write a "Read Only" proxy. Throw an IllegalAccessException on any attempt
to call a method by name "set*" on the target object and allow any call
on methods called "get*".
