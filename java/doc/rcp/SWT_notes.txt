Notes on how to properly create a standalone SWT application:
=============================================================
There are three ways in which to create such an application all of
them involving getting the appropriate SWT jar into your project.

a. the "just add the jar from eclipse approach"
	1. create a standard java project or use an existing one.
	2. find the swt jar under your eclipse installation. It
	should be under $ECLIPSE/plugins and it should have a
	name like:
	org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_3.3.1.v3346i.jar
	(with your platform ofcourse).
	3. add this jar to your project.
	4. use and be happy.

	* in this approach you do not need to download anything.
	* you are sure that the SWT version you will use is the
	right for your platform (is your eclipse is running that
	is).
	* you do not get the "latest and greatest" SWT.
	* you do not get the full SWT integration into eclipse.

b. the "download and add the jar approach"
	1. go to http://www.eclipse.org/swt/ and download SWT
	as appropriate for your platform.
	2. unzip it and find the appropriate jar in it. Since
	downloaded the version for your platform the jar INSIDE
	the archive is going to be called "swt.jar" plainly.
	3. add it to a new java standard project or an existing one.
	4. use and be happy.

	* this approach requires that you download stuff.
	* in return you get the option to use the "latest and
	greatest".
	* it may not run (as with all "greatest" software).
	* you do not get the full SWT integration into eclipse.

c. the "full integration with bells and whistles approach"
	1. go to http://www.eclipse.org/swt/ and download SWT
	as appropriate for your platform.
	2. do not unzip it but rather import it as a project
	directly into your workspace.
	3. create a new standard java project or use an existing one.
	4. make your project DEPEND on the existing SWT project.
	5. use and be happy.
	
	* this approach requires that you download stuff.
	* in return you get the option to use the "latest and
	greatest".
	* it may not run (as with all "greatest" software).
	* you get the full SWT integration into eclipse.
