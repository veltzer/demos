Build system:
=============
- add checkstyle support and set my own style.
- seperate the java to it's own project (javaapi).
- add ant to build the entire project.
- add code formatter to format all of my code to a single style.
- get ridd of the jars in '/lib' and use the ones from the OS
	to reduce the size of this project.

Extreme:
========
- add an example showing how long it takes to take locks in java.
	compare that to atomics.

Swing:
======
- how do dialogs work (with thread ids).
	Show how does dialog.show() works (and how does it continue as if
	on the same thread).
- showing all threads of a java JVM with a tree model.
- disks full application with custom cell renderer.
	(I already have the begining of this).
