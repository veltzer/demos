Build system:
=============
- add a script to suppress the verbose info coming out of
	the checkstyle.
- get to full manual make build.
- run eclipse-jee and:
	- make sure everything builds
	- make sure that all projects have an src folder (even web ones).
- see that all projects build from the command line (all lint with warnings).
- get all eclipse plugins and jdic from the web (in any way).
- separate the java project as a lean and mean project on it's own.
- get ridd of deprecated APIs so that ant build with be with deprecation true.
- do a script that checks the names of the projects.
- seperate the java to it's own project (javaapi).
- add ant to build the entire project.
- get ridd of the jars in '/lib' and use the ones from the OS
	to reduce the size of this project.
	If I'm not happy with that then use maven to bring the jars
	to ~/.m2.

code:
=====
- remove interbit references from the code.
- make sure that the author is just me.

Extreme:
========
- add an example showing how long it takes to take locks in java.
	compare that to atomics.

Swing:
======
- how do dialogs work (with thread ids).
	Show how does dialog.show() works (and how does it continue as if
	on the same thread).
- showing all threads of a java JVM with a tree model.
- disks full application with custom cell renderer.
	(I already have the begining of this).
