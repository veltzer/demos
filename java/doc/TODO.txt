General:
========
- see that everything works (including resources).
- add the java programming course examples.
- add an example showing how long it takes to take locks in java.
	compare that to atomics.

Swing demos:
============
- how do dialogs work (with thread ids).
	Show how does dialog.show() works (and how does it continue as if
	on the same thread).
- showing all threads of a java JVM with a tree model.
- disks full application with custom cell renderer.
	(I already have the begining of this).
