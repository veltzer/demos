- make sure that your java is configured correctly:
	java -version
	javac -version
	echo $JAVA_HOME
	should all agree.
- make sure you have python installed.
- first run './scripts/ubuntu_install.py' to make sure you have ivy and ant jars.
- then run ant resolve to get a 'lib' folder with all the jars you need.
- now you can just run 'ant' to build the whole thing.
