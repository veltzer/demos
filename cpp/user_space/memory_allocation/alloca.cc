/*
 * This example shows how to allocate space on the stack using the alloca(3) function call.
 * This function is actually inlined assembly that never fails and only increments the stack
 * pointer and so is VERY VERY VERY fast. On the other hand it has it's own issues.
 *
 * On a standard linux machine this test will fail when reaching about 10M of ram. If you want
 * more then you can use setrlimit with the stack size you want to get more or use ulimit(1)
 * on the command line before running your program.
 *
 * Notice that once you set a limit using ulimit(1) on the command line then using this program
 * would fail since the limit was already set and so cannot be made higher (ulimit security).
