Mechanisms of synchronization in Linux:
=======================================
- no synchronization
	Just use a different data structure per thread and avoid synchronization at all.
	This is the best solution and the fastest.

	Caveat: On Intel the CPU caches are synchronized and so if the two CPUs access
	different memory areas which reside in the same CPU cache line (cache lines on
	Intel are usually 64 byte wide) then one CPU will delay the execution of code
	by another. Just make sure to have data structures wide enough.

	* TODO:
	show how to find the cache line width both as compile time constant and as
	runtime variable. Show how to pad a data structure correctly so that it will
	be wide enough.
	
	When should you use them?
	This is the most efficient synchronization mechanism as it has no overhead.

- atomic variables.
	__sync_fetch_and_add and the like.
	Why shouldn't you just use an int? You can, if you just increment it and do not
	necessarily want to see the value. But usually you want to do two things atomically
	like: add and fetch, fetch and add, fetch and sub, sub and fetch, test and set
	and more. If you try to do that then you run into a syncrhonization problem because
	the value that you use may be:
	- stored in a register (each CPU has it's own registers) and not even synchronized
	with memory at all.
	- stored in memory but because of synchronization got meddled with between the two
	operations that you did on it.
	- stored in memory and looks differently to the two (or more) CPUs. This cannot
	happen on Intel but can certainly happen on other platforms.

	When should you use them?
	- when the atomic operation is the only thing you want to do in the critical
	section and it satisfies you.

	This is the best synchronization mechanism if you have to have synchronization at all.

- spinlock.
	These are implemented using atomic variables and yielding.
