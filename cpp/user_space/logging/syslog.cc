/*
 * This example shows syslog basic usage. At the end it demostrates that the log
 * actually reached the system log.
 *
 * It seems that the openlog and closelog are not mandatory...
 * If you leave them out then you will not get your own name as the application
 * name and so you get defaults for parameters passed to openlog.
 *
 * How is syslog implemented? Either as a socket or udp socket.
 *
 * A question that is often raised is what is the performance of syslog compared to
 * printf to a file - the answer is faster since it is sending the data through the socket
 * and does not wait for it to be written to disk.
