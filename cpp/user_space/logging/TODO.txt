- how to print back traces.
- measure times for all debugging.
- demo on how to put the debug file on a ram disk.
- libcwd logging.
- boost logging.
- buffering examples to show how to line buffer files for logging.
- show the difference between syslog times and standard log (printf) times.
	explain the difference.
	explain advantages and disadvantages of using each.
- do very fast logging example: open a shared memory and copy messages to it
	using memcpy and some kind of synchronization.
	Do a daemon that reads from the shared memory and transfers to syslog
	or whatever.
- do an example of showing the nesting level with the debug info automatically!
	(do this using function entry and exit markers, either explicit or implicit...).
- do an example which combines everything together:
	- compiler builtins (__FILE__,...).
	- nesting levels.
	- syslog.
	- backtraces.
