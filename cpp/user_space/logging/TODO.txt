more examples that I need to put here:
1. how to use __FILE__, __LINE__, __FUNCTION__.
	__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ (c++ demangle).
2. how to print back traces.
3. measure times for all debugging.
3. demo on how to put the debug file on a ram disk.
4. libcwd logging.
5. boost logging.
6. buffering examples to show how to line buffer files for logging.
7. show the difference between syslog times and standard log (printf) times.
	explain the difference.
	explain advantages and disadvantages of using each.
8. do very fast logging example: open a shared memory and copy messages to it
	using memcpy and some kind of synchronization.
	Do a daemon that reads from the shared memory and transfers to syslog
	or whatever.
