/*
 * This example explores the workings of memset...
 *
 * From the disassembly we can see that:
 * - no call to memset is used since memset is a macro.
 *	(you cannot break on memset in the debuffer and actually stop on that function)
 * - this means that memset inline assembly is inserted into our code.
 * - the compiler uses "rep stos" for to do the actual memsetting which is
 *	a single machine instruction on Intel which means that it is very efficient.
 * - the wmemset function not inline assembly (you cannot break on it in the debugger)
 * - this example does not explore the inner workins of the wmemset function (meanins whether
 *	it is implemented efficiently or not).
 *
 * TODO: find out how wmemset work and discuss it's efficiency.
