These are more examples to write under this topic:
- show a primitive example of pstree.

- extend the make_zombie example.
	Show that if the parent dies then the child gets
		adopted by init(1) and is cleared.
	Show what happens to children of a zombie that it did not take care of
		(grandchildren). They will die since their parent (the zombie)
		is dead and will never clear them and so they will be adopted
		by init and are cleared.
