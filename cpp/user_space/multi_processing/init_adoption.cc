/*
 * This example demostrates what happens when a processes father dies...
 *
 * - Notice that the getppid() function returns different values because of the
 *   adoption by the init(1) process.
 * - This example forks twice to show that there is no "grandparent adoption" and
 *   that grandparents are not interested in their grandchildren.
 * - We need to wait a little to make sure that the parent dies - there is no synchroneous
 *   way to get this info as far as I know...
 *
 * TODO:
 * - investigate how it is exactly that init does the things he does (is it the kernel as I
 *   suspect that latches processes under the init process ?!? - if so, find the place
 *   in the kernel that does this...).
