Exercise 3
Write a program that will update a global variable LockingCounter.
We have to protect the variable that only one thread will be able to update it.
We will use 3 threads.
1. The initial value of LockingCounter is zero.
2. Use 3 threads each one of them will try to increment the LockingCounter.
3. Each thread will use mutex to prevent other thread from updating or testing
   this variable. 
4. Only if LockingCounter modulu 3 is = 0 then thread 1 will do the increment.
5. Only if LockingCounter modulu 3 is = 1 then thread 2 will do the increment.
6. Only if LockingCounter modulu 3 is = 2 then thread 3 will do the increment.
7. At the end print the value of LockingCounter as well as the total number of
   tests for changing the counter.
