1. Write an example using futexes.
2. Write an example that demostrates priorities.
	a. Show an example showing different nice levels.
	b. Show an example showing priority in the same nice level.
	c. Show running a real time process.
	d. Show inversion of priority.
3. Write an example using NTPL and not posix threads.
1. examples using NTPL.
2. Starting a thread in suspended mode (pthread or NTPL).
3. Show code of mutexes in pthread with timeout.

This is a list of examples I need to write to demo expert
use of signals in a C/C++ linux application.

1. Application which receives a SIGTERM and in the sig handler
marks a boolean value for the main application to check.
The main application runs in a loop and checks the boolean
variable regularly and stops it's work once the signal arrives.

2. Application which generates a SIGSEGV by doing some illegal
memory access. The application handles this signal in it's
own code and then calls the default handler (which creates
a core dump).

3. Application which shows how to pass extra information using
a signal handler.

4. Application which generates an FPE, then does not core dump
but rather continues processing. Show how to know where the FPE
came from (extra information?).

5. Show combinations of signal handlers and C++ exceptions. Where
do they conflict and where do they match.
