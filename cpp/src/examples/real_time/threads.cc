/*
 * This application should show how to create real time threads...
 *
 * It demos:
 * - setting of priority.
 * - setting guard for the threads (good for debug).
 * - prefetching the threads (automatically).
 * - afining the threads to a cpu.
 * - locking all memory (mlock).
 * - blocking all malloc from that moment onward.
