/*
 *	This is an example showing how to sleep for very short periods of
 *	time and proves that it is indeed so...
 *
 *	As you can see there is a diff of about 100 micro between the time
 *	to sleep and the real time slept. This is MUCH less than the HZ
 *	value for linux (ranging from 100HZ to 1000HZ which yields 10000 micro
 *	to 1000 micro which are much bigger values.
 *
 *	In order to actually prove this there is still a need to split this
 *	program into two threads the higher priority of which runs this
 *	code and the lower keeping the CPU occupied all the time (by doing
 *	some calculation). According to expection the difference from the
 *	expected sleep time should remain about 100 micro.
 *
 *	Where does this 100 micro come from ? The answer lies in the accuracy
 *	of the interrupt handler, it's clock and the time to reschedule...
 *	The real time patch to the kernel can reduce this further...
 *
 *	Take note that nanosleep does not involve signals and so is 'signal
 *	safe' and on machines with a good rtc will use it. read more in the
 *	documentation.

 * TODO:
 * - it seems that this example does not work well in Ubuntu since the
 *	cpu_freq function returns 0 as the frequency of the cpu. Find out why
 *	and fix the example.
 * - use usleep and sleep also and compare the results to those of nanosleep.
