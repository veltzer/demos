/*
 *	This example shows how to use the C++ operator new placement
 *	operator.
 *
 *	Things we learn:
 *	1. How to write your own placement function.
 *	2. Regular constructor gets called after the placement.
 *	3. Releasing of space could be overridden too.
 *	4. This could be used for caching and real time considerations for instance.
 *	5. Even if you allocate an array the delete[] is NOT called so
 *		your regular delete operator needs to know how to do the job
 *		both for arrays and for single elements (if you want arrays
 *		at all that is...).
