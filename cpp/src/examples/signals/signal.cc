/*
 * This is a simple example which shows how to do signal handling with the
 * signal(2) syscall. Mind you that this is the old system call and there is a
 * better sigaction(2) syscall at your disposal.
 *
 * Things to note:
 * - the same signal handler can be used for handling more than one signal.
 * - if you send a signal when the signal handler is active then it is not
 *	activated (meaning that the code that you write need not be re-entrant).
 * - the signal is remmember though and will be activated the first thing after
 *	the signal handler is over.
 * - the system does not remmember more than 1 signal. It actually has a bit
 *	mask of waiting signals so each waiting signal is either on or off.
 * - the pause(2) call can be used to block until a signal arrives an provide
 *	you with a non-busy wait loop on signals.
