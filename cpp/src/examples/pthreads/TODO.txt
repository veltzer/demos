- do example of an OO wrapper for pthreads.
	in the wrapper each thread will have a name.
	Add the ability to connect via telnet to this application and see all of
	it's threads.
	show how this is solved in ACE and Boost and stdlibc++.

- do the example of measuring thread performance as in the manual entry of
	pthread_getcpuclockid

- do examples of
	pthread_atfork
	pthread_detach
	pthread_once
	pthread_cancel
	pthread_cleanup_pop
	pthread_cleanup_push

- do an example of named semaphore usage:
	sem_* functions.

- show usage of pthread_exit. Actually, show all ways that allow one to exit a thread
	- pthread_exit
	- pthread_cancel.
	- send sigkill to the thread.
	- more ?!?

- do demo of one stack stepping over another one.

- add examples about threads and stacks:
	1) two threads which show that one thread can step over the stack of the
	other thread with using a very large stack.
	2) show the use of pthread_attr_setguardsize to protect one thread from the other.
	3) show the use of pthread_attr_setstacksize and pthread_attr_getstacksize to control
		stack sizes.
	4) show using pthread_attr_setstacksize to overcome thread stack issues.
