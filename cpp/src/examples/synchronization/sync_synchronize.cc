/*
 * This is a demo to show how sync_synchronize() is implemented...
 * You should see the __sync_synchronize which is a machine memory barrier
 * translated to a "lock orl" instruction in assembly which is an instruction
 * to the core you are running on to stop reading from the cache.
 * So you should see one instruction in the disassembly of this code.
 * And indeed this is what we see.
 *
 * Take note that this is a also a compiler barrier. It prevents the compiler
 * from reordering around this code. You don't see any assembly emitted for
 * that since a compiler barrier is only a compile time instruction about
 * code emittion.
