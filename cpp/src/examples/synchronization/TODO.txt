These are the list of more demos to write in the realm of synchronization:
- example of event passing between threads (eventfd).
- C++ api of a mutex that has a name. In addition the api can report on
	all mutexes which are currently taken and by which threads (threads by name
	that is).
- example of how to iterate the list of currently held futexes in user space
	in order to report which mutexes are taken. From the C futex pointer
	try to go back to the c++ object wrapping it and print it's name.
- do a demo of inter-process mutexes using sem_open, sem_close, sem_wait and the like.
