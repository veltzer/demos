/*
 * This example creates a pthread_mutex which is a futex, grabs it and releases
 * it. Run it with strace to see that it does not call any system call.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - there is no syscall involved with this futex AT ALL! This is because this futex is private
 *   and therefore not robust. Futexes can be robust in which case you need to tell that at creation
 *   which will notify the kernel about this futex.
 *   by default futexes are private.
 *   This means that even creation of futexes is cheap.
 *
 * Problem:
 * - even if I create a process shared mutex the pthread library calls no syscall at mutex_init time!!!
 *   How can this be if the futex is robust?!? investigate...
