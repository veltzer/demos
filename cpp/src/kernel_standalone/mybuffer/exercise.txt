Write a kernel module that holds a buffer in kernel space.
The kernel module implements a character device driver and thus
allows user space to read and write to that buffer.

* Do not worry about synchronisation, wakeup, go to sleep or any of that.

test your driver this way:
$ echo "hello" > /dev/mybuffer
$ cat /dev/mybuffer
