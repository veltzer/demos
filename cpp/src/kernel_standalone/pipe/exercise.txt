This is a pipe exercise:

create a module that exposes files in /dev of the form:
/dev/pipe[0-8]

Each pipe represents a PAGE_SIZE buffer in kernel.
Allow reading and writing to the pipe.

Take care of synchronization.

If a reader wants to read and there is no data in the pipe and also there
are no writers, return EOF to the reader.

Compare your results with the Linux implementation of a pipe, use pipemeter.
Are your results better? Worse? Why?
