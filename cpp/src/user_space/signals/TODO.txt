- improve the sigfd example and show show to do signal handling in conjunction with io.
- demonstrate the blocking of signals via sigprocmask.
- demonstrate the use of real time signals (receiving and sending via sigqueue).
- demonstrate stuff you can do with sigaction(2) as opposed to signal(2).
- demonstrate the use of sigpending(2).
- many more signal functions: see man -k sig | grep 2
- demonstrate the implementation of a function like sleep(3) using SIGALRM and pause.
- demonstrate the use of pause to implement async io with signals.
