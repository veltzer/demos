/*
 *	This is an example of a compiler barrier
 *	This example needs to be compiled with optimizations to see it in action.
 *	View the resulting assembly code with:
 *	objdump --disassemble --line-numbers --source --demangle barrier
 *
 *	The gcc compiler barrier
 *	========================
 *	is the asm(memory) one. It is not a CPU reordering barrier - just a compiler
 *	one.
 *	It seems that gcc does not have the notion of a *read* vs *write*
 *	barrier which could come in handly instead of this dominating
 *	*FULL* barrier.
 *
 *	Function call barriers
 *	======================
 *	On some platforms/compilers these are also memory barriers but no so in gcc
 *	that assumes that functions that are called do not change the content of registers
 *	(and if they do, they put back everything the way they found it...). In any case
 *	you cannot really rely on them since you are not sure which functions are macros,
 *	inlines etc. Better to use an official compiler barrier. I picked a function that
 *	is definately not an inlined one and still this it does not perform well as
 *	a compiler barrier (srandom on gcc 4.5.2).
 *
 *	Machine memory barriers
 *	=======================
 *	is the __sync_synchronize() one. There doesn't seem to be a read vs write
 *	one. This does not serve as a compiler barrier as is evident as a result
 *	of this program.
 *
 *	Empty assembly block
 *	====================
 *	Used to work in some versions of gcc but stopped working. Better not to use.
 *

 *	TODO:
 *	- make this program show the instructions that are emitted for main so
 *	that people could see the assembly code generated.
