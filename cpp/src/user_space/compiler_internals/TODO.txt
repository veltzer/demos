- add another example that shows why volatile is bad (base it on the kernel
	article about volatiles being harmful).
- do the example in the reference:
	http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/archives/2007/02/17/barrier/
- investigate further the compiler barrier. The volatile part vs the memory
	part. show when each is neccessary.
- is there a user space version of cpu_relax of kernel space ?!?
