/*
 *      This is an example of what happens when you read from a bad fd.
 *      The important thing to note is that you do not SEGFAULT. Technically
 *      you called a syscall with the wrong parameter and what you get back
 *      is an error.
 *      Note yet that read(2) return type is ssize_t which is SIGNED as opposed to size_t
 *      which is UNSIGNED. The idea here is the ability to return -1 and report errors
 *      this way.
