/*
 *      This is a test which will explain which methods in the driver are
 *      called. Here are the scenarios which are shown:
 *      - a single process opening and closing.
 *      - a pair of processes both opening and closing the same file.
 *      - a process which open a file and dies.
 *      - two processes one which dies.
 *
 *      This example explains when open and release are called.
 *      open - is called when a unique new fd is created based on the device driver file.
 *              It is NOT called when an already existing fd is duplicated like in the
 *              case of fork(2) or dup(2).
 *      release - is called when the final fd of the last process is closed. This means
 *              that no userspace process still holds a connection to that fd.
 *              It is NOT called when a close(2) occurs which is not the last one...
 *      Common questions are:
 *              1. how do I know within the driver that a certain process
 *              that talked to my driver died?
 *              2. how do I know within the driver that a new process
 *              was created that is using a file descriptor that I am serving?
 *              3. how do I know within the driver that a file descriptor
 *              that I am serving just god dupped?
 *              Some attempts at answers:
 *              - you don't. file descriptors in UNIX are NOT tied to
 *              one process - they may be shared. You only get notification when they
 *              are created or finally destroyed.
 *              - don't shared file descriptors. Close them in the parent or child if
 *              you fork or only open them after forks.
 *              - have every process which closes the descriptor do
 *              an ioctl(2) on it before closing notifying you. The same could be done
 *              after fork(2) or dup(2)...
