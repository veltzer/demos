- add a semaphore demo. include/asm/semaphore.h

- check that spin_lock_bh actually works by waiting in the kernel and seeing the DPC not enter...
	do a demo that shows this.

- there are TODO items in each demo to be done.

- format the sources exactly the way I want (no "  " etc...).

- remove unneeded include files.

- do not repeat the description of each module both in the comments and in the
MODULE_DESCRIPTION macro. Instead use only the MODULE_DESCRIPTION macro. Put it right
above the comments describing the module in detail.

- Add a comment on each include stating what is it there for.
