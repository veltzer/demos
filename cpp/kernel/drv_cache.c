MODULE_DESCRIPTION("This demo is to show how to create caches and use them.");

/*
 * Why would you need your own cache? Or, to put it another way, is kmalloc/kfree not enough ?!?
 * Well, it depends on what you are doing. If you are doing very infrequent allocations (say on
 * init and cleanup and maybe on open and close) then you should be fine with kmalloc/kfree. If,
 * on the other hand, you are allocating lots and lots of tiny objects (imagine the network stack
 * for a second) and releasing them very frequently, and you wish to be able to debug exactly
 * how many of those you are using at any point in time, then the cache is better suited to your needs.
 * The cache also gives you the guarantee that once you populate it you are not going to be surprised
 * by allocation functions failing.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - do the allocation and deallocation from the cache via ioctl and add a user
 *	space demo application that shows slabtop(1) and /proc/slabinfo as it is allocating
 *	and deallocating.
