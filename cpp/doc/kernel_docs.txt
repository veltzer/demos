- If you want to find the kernel headers that you are using they are under:
	/usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`/include/linux on ubuntu systems.

- On an ubuntu/debian system you can install a package called:
	linux-source-[version]
	which will give you the official source code (including patches)
	for that kernel version.
	The source comes in the form of a tar ball in /usr/src.
	If you open it in place then the official source is usually at:
	/usr/src/linux-source-[version].
