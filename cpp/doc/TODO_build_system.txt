- the build system does not do dependencies!!!
- write a script that use "git ls-files" and a recursive traveral of a directory
	to show all files which are not under git control
	this way I could check after a "make clean" there are no leftovers.
- unify everything to one makefile.
- make the output of the makefile look nicer.
- add a feature to the makefile that deduces all the libraries that I'm using
and all the packages that I need (and installs them ?!?).
