- bring back the hellofcmp example once I have built an fcmp package for ubuntu.
	and installed it on the laptop.
- core dump example: show how an application can dump its own core
and continue running (gcore on the cmd line, sending itself a signal,
running the right function).
- give an example of a binary that accesses it's own symbols by name.
	ld_ functions with NULL.
- do a user space example that compares various ways of getting a time stamp
	(rdtsc, gettimeofday, getclock, ...)
- do a user space program that measures the rdtsc progress vs time
	and compares it to the values taken from the cpufreq library.

- do an example that links dlls together and create a "mega dll".
- do an example that links object files + a bunch of dlls into a "exe + dlls in one file" package. This way this exe can have backtrace capability with good symbol names. Demo it.

- add my signature to all those examples with some copyright.

do a demo of using the rtc in an application.
Demo the accuracy of those sleeps as compared to an application using a regular clock
Show that when using the RTC the interrupts are coming in (/etc/interrupts) not via
the timer interrupts but rather through the RTC line...

1. Add a demo about how to catch this exception from regular C code using signal and
	sigaction and show what can be done about it (c level).
3. Example of how to raise exceptions on all system calls.
	C++ wrapper for all system calls.
4. Examples of debugging malloc stuff:
	showing statistics of malloc,
	hooking into the malloc free hooks
	replacing the malloc library.
5. Expand the example BreakOut.cc to show that you can break out of other system calls too (for example shmget).

1. Write an example using futexes.
2. Write an example that demostrates priorities.
	a. Show an example showing different nice levels.
	b. Show an example showing priority in the same nice level.
	c. Show running a real time process.
	d. Show inversion of priority.
3. Write an example using NTPL and not posix threads.
1. examples using NTPL.
2. Starting a thread in suspended mode (pthread or NTPL).
3. Show code of mutexes in pthread with timeout.

This is a list of examples I need to write to demo expert
use of signals in a C/C++ linux application.

1. Application which receives a SIGTERM and in the sig handler
marks a boolean value for the main application to check.
The main application runs in a loop and checks the boolean
variable regularly and stops it's work once the signal arrives.

2. Application which generates a SIGSEGV by doing some illegal
memory access. The application handles this signal in it's
own code and then calls the default handler (which creates
a core dump).

3. Application which shows how to pass extra information using
a signal handler.

4. Application which generates an FPE, then does not core dump
but rather continues processing. Show how to know where the FPE
came from (extra information?).

5. Show combinations of signal handlers and C++ exceptions. Where
do they conflict and where do they match.

- profile how long it takes to setup a timer from user space.
        (this is for the userspace guys - do an example).
- show how to break from a blocking sys call in user space using a signal.
        show how to do this using a timer thus turning each sys call to timed.
        show that the wakeup is pretty near the expected time (rdtsc).
- do example of fifo and priorities in pthreads.

creating temp files correctly:
==============================
mkdtemp(3), mktemp(3), tempnam(3), tmpfile(3), tmpnam(3)
talk about the security issues involved in these.
- there is already one example of mine which works with temp files.

- do a demo of two processes syncing via futex in shared memory (c++ stuff).
- do a demo of using compare and set to sync two processes (c++ stuff).
