This is a pre 2.6.31 block device driver demo.
It does not compile with post 2.6.31 kernels!!!
Do not use this for a demo on a modern Linux system.

I already have this demo along with all my regular demos.
I need to integrate the code here carefully with #ifdefs so that
the new driver will also compile with old kernels.
