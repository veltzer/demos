- finish slides for two methods of embedding.
	(at least 5 more slides could be written from the article).
- finish the GString material.
- more about classes.
- write closure slides (I already have examples)
- write slides about while loops (with example).

- basic syntax comments.
	functions.
	classes.
	tri state (? : syntax).
- finish more closure examples:
	2) delegates.
	3) modifying the closure value from outside (is that possible)
	write slides about closures.
- do slides about gpars or parallel groovy.
