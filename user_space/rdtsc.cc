/*
 *      This is a demo which shows how, on i386 platforms, to read the rdtsc
 *      register in order to get a high precision timer. Mind you, you must
 *      be running on a machine that does not do frequency scaling in order
 *      for this to work...
 *
 *      TODO:
 *      - add reading of the cpu frequency.
 *      - add diffing the two values.
 *      - add measuring absolute time via the cpu frequency.
 *
 *      If you compare the results of this test with the cpu frequency information
 *      provided by the OS you will find a slight difference.
 *
 *      Where does this difference come from?
 *      The sleep(3) call which is called here is handled by the OS using the PIC
 *      interrupt handler clock while the RDTSC register that we call is from the
 *      CPU internal clock. This means that we are comparing two different clocks!
 *      In addition to all of this setting the fact that the CPU reports that it's
 *      frequency is 600 MHz doesn't means that it ticks: 600,000,000 (600 million
 *      times) per seconds exactly...
