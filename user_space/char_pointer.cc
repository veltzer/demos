/*
 *      This demo shows several different things:
 *      1. If you define a 'const' pointer in C++ then you can assign any
 *      other const pointer of the same type to it.
 *      2. The compiler issues an error whenever your program tries to write to
 *      the const pointer.
 *      3. You can force acess to a "const char*" string storage via pointer manipulation.
 *      The compiler will not stop you there.
 *      4. If you do try to access that memory space you will get a segfault.
 *      5. You get the segfault because constant strings are allocated in read only memory.
 *      6. The fact that constat strings are allocated in read only memory allows the
 *      compiler to optimize this memory and never store the same string twice.
 *      7. If you optimize your program (-O2) then the compiler makes some of your memory
 *      access functions go away and so you don't segfault.
