Friends, Romans, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Ceasar, not to praise him.
The evil man do lives after them;
The good is oft intered with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;
If it were so, it was a grieveous fault,
And grievously hath Ceasar answered it.
Here, under the leave of Brutus and the rest-
For brutus is an honorable;
Beware of the Ides of March;
He was my freind, faithful and just to me;
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
But Brutus says that he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the genral coffer fills:
Did this in Ceasar seem ambitious ?
When that poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambitious should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

You all did see that on Luperval
I thrice presented a queenly crown,
Which he did thrice refused: was this ambition ?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I'm to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him ?
O judgement! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their mourn reason. Bear with me;
My heart is in the cheap wooden box there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.
