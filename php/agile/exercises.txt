1. Install phpunit on the virtual server you are a developer of.
	wget http://pear.php.net/go-pear
	php ./go-pear
	(answer the questions as needed... accept the defaults
		when asked about a prefix answer with '/usr'.
	).
	pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
	pear install -a phpunit/PHPUnit
2. Take the simple test you did yesterday. Put it somewhere in your code.
	Run it from the command line and check that it works.
3. Write a test for your own classes!
	Write four tests:
	1. positive test (which is not supposed to throw an exception)
	2. negative test (which is supposed to throw an exception).
		NOTE - you have no ExceptionTestCase.php in your
		version of PHPUnit.
	3. output test that checks the output of a class or API.
	4. performance test which checks that a certain API does
		not take more than X seconds to run.

4. In order to do xdebug + coverage test here is what you should do:
	1. Install xdebug (pecl install xdebug).
	2. enable xdebug in /etc/php.ini
		zend_extension="[abs path to xdebug.so]"
	* remmember to comment out previous mention of zend_extension.
	3. create a empty folder to hold the reports.
	4. run the coverage test this way:
		phpunit --coverage-html [folder you create] myfile.php
