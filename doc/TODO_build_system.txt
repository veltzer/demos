- do a target that compresses ALL demos (or all demos for a specific purpose:
	php, python etc).
- add a clean kernel target for the makefile.

- the build system does not do dependencies!!!
- write a script that use "git ls-files" and a recursive traveral of a directory
	to show all files which are not under git control
	this way I could check after a "make clean" there are no leftovers.
- unify everything to one makefile.
- make the output of the makefile look nicer.
- add a feature to the makefile that deduces all the libraries that I'm using
and all the packages that I need (and installs them ?!?).

- sometimes the kernel modules are rebuilt even thought they are built - probably
	a bug in the makefile but i can't seem to find it.
