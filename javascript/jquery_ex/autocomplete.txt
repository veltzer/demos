Building an auto-complete widget using jQuery:
==============================================
Build an auto-comlete text box. The text box will get the suggestions for
auto-completion from the server side.
Make your life easier developing this widget by having a hard coded list
of completion suggestions on the client side *and only then* switch
to doing real ajax wioth the server side.

When the user clicks something, find all the strings which have the prefix
that the user already typed in, and show then all as a combo box.
First implement your widget as a combo box.

The user will use your widget like this:
var my_textfield=new AutoCompleteTextField("#mydivid","name","complete.php");

The last parameter is a *server side url* to be used as completion.

Use JSON as the data transder format from client to server and back again.
