Create a widget using jquery which is a sophisticated submit button.

The button should be connected by the user to any number of validating
fields. Use the validating fields implemented in the previous exercise.

The button should listen on validation/invalidation messages from those
fields. If any field declares that it is invalid then the submittion
button should disable itself.

Here is how the client would use this new widget:

	var field1=new ValidatingTextField(...)
	var field2=new ValidatingTextField(...)
	var submitButton=new SubmitButton(
		"#mydivid",
		"text to show on the button"
	);
	submitButton.addField(field1);
	submitButton.addField(field2);
