<!--
An example of diverting javascript functions. In the case the native function document.write.
Notice that we are inserting our own function as a replacement for the original 'document.write'.
We are doing it on the actual document object.

<script>
	document.write('Hello, World!<br/>')
	var oldfunc=document.write
	document.write=function() {
		// no write for you
	}
	document.write('Where did this go ?');
	// this line does not work because it is a method and must be called from an object context
	//oldfunc('This one is through oldfunc');
	// this one would work:
	oldfunc.call(document,'hey there<br/>');
	document.write=oldfunc;
	document.write('This is the proper write back<br/>');
	document.write(oldfunc+'<br/>');
</script>
