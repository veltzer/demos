This example shows how to use the console.assert API
Notes:
- you can add as many messages as you like to the assert failure.

<script>
	function bar() {
		// a failed assertion
		console.assert(2==1,'2 is not 1','another msg','as many messages as you like');
		console.log('you should not see this');
	}
	function foo() {
		bar();
	}
	foo();
</script>
