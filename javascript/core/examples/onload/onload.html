<!--
This is the most basic example of using window.onload.
When you do it you step over any other function that was registered
in this way.
-->
<html>
	<head>
		<script>
			function init() {
				alert("The windows was loaded");
			}
			window.onload = init;
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
		This is the body
	</body>
</html>
