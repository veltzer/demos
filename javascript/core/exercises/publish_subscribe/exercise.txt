- Write a 'dojo' like publish/subscribe system.

	A publisher would call: publish(event,[data]);
	A subscriber would call: subscribe(event,object,method);

	The method 'method' on the object 'object' would be called whenever
	an event is fired. The data would be passed to that method.

- Extra credit:
	-allow to unsubscribe.
	-do it OO style.
	-wrap in a singleton.
