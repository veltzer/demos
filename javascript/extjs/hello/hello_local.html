<!--
A basic local hello world example for ExtJs
local means that the extjs code itself comes from the local server.

Note:
- notice we write in the code in the "head" section of the HTML file.
	That is recommended.
- We are also showing example of Ext.require, Ext.onReady and Ext.MessageBox.
- you can choose between different versions of ext-all (see below).

		This one is for standard development. Allows you to drill down in debuggers
